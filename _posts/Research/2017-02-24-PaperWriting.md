   * > A summary of the research problem , your claim and the evidence .

   * What do you want to talk about in this paper ? 
   * Is there any challenge in your research domain ?
   * What's your contribution with your methods in the challenge ?
   * Please show the evaluation of your methods (such as 'the state-of-the-art')

3. Introduction 

   * > **Motivation**,a re-statement of the abstract in formation, **significance**,an outline of the rest of the paper
