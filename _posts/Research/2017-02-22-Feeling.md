  For many students , they are optimistic about their career and life but vice versa to me . I am so frustrated that I cannot obtain the ability to clearly express my thoughts . From my sentence to sentence , you can perceive my limp and poverty in English . For all this ,I also have the confidence to strive for my future and prepare to promte my written English and spoken English step by step which may need endeavour in peacetime .  

  Yes. half-hearted is my middle name which stems me to conquer dilemma day by day nonetheless the present and future is gripped in my hand only if I want to make change by nuts and bolts.
