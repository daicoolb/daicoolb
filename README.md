This is a bolg repository.

I have tried different themes and different platforms. At last, I choose the jekyll as the background.

Here is the source code.

It bases on the my jekyll theme [Yummy-Jekyll](https://github.com/DONGChuan/Yummy-Jekyll)

I hope one day I can implement a whole blog which is only designed by myself.
