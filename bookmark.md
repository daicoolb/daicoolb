[![](https://jaywcjlove.github.io/sb/ico/awesome.svg)](#) [![](https://jaywcjlove.github.io/sb/license/mit.svg)](#)

For the convenience of reading, I collect some basic and important papers about recommender system.

**Here is the main conferences within recommender system and some categories which I think is interesting**:
 - [KDD](http://www.kdd.org/) the community for data mining, data science and analytics.
 - [ICDM](http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~icdm/) draws researchers and application developers from a wide range of data mining related areas such as statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, databases and data warehousing, data visualization, knowledge-based systems, and high performance computing.
